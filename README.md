# Undent

> This's just a fork of the original repository with the binary file added so you don't have to compile it yourself.

To see how it could be used in action, see the tweet from [@fatih](https://github.com/fatih/) https://twitter.com/fatih/status/1236067718266105857

## Usage

If you use [Alfred with Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/), you can download [the workflow](https://github.com/AAlakkad/undent/releases/latest); copy the code then paste it with `CMD+SHIFT+V` it will unindent it then paste it to the current application.

Alternatively, you can grab the binary from the [release page](https://github.com/AAlakkad/undent/releases/latest) to a directory in your `$PATH`, e.g. `/usr/local/bin` and do whatever you want with it ðŸ¤—
